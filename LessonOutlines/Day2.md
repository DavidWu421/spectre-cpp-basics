## Day 2

- Start with Hello

- Empty square struct

- Length, width variables, print perimeter

- Perimeter function

- Constructor function instead of setting members by hand

- Challenge: make a second rectangle, rect2, and check that the perimeter is correct

- Private length and width

- Struct vs class

- Challenge: add a member function that returns the area

- Add evil_area() that changes the length after computing the area, show how
const member functions prevents this

- Add static const number_of_sides variable and function: same for all rectangles, introduce <cstddef>, size_t

- Challenge: change static variable to static function that takes no arguments and returns the number of sides

- Make class square inherit from rectangle (': public Rectangle' after class name), different constructor
