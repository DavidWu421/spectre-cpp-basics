## Lesson 1

### Meeting 1

- Hello

- Add an arg that isnâ€™t const

- Make function use <cmath> to compute sqrt(1-x^2)

- Add evil_print() function that prints x then changes it, show how const
saves you from evil_print()

- const and constexpr for variables

- Add function to do left integral

- noexcept: enables compiler optimizations, says your code will not throw an exception

### Meeting 2

- constexpr example

- remake our example computing pi with the left-point rule

- Add correction to do trap instead of left, show how error drops

- Add overload taking function pointer, instead of hard-coding function f

- Challenge: add your own function that returns exp(x)

- Factor trap into hpp, cpp

- Copy trap into hpp, cpp, 

- Add a new class, Left.hpp and Left.cpp

- Challenge: have the executable print out difference from Pi for both Trap and Left

- spectre examples of functions, const, noexcept, constexpr: irreducible mass, christodoulou mass, ...
