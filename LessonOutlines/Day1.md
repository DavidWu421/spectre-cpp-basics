## Day 1

- Hello

- Print a double

- Call a function with no args

- Add an arg that isnâ€™t const

- Make function use <cmath> to compute sqrt(1-x^2)

- Add evil_print() function that prints x then changes it, show how const
saves you from evil_print()

- Add function to do left integral
- Add correction to do trap instead of left, show how error drops

- Add overload taking std::function<>, instead of hard-coding function f

- Challenge: add your own function that returns exp(x)

- Factor trap into hpp, cpp

- Challenge: copy trap into hpp, cpp, and make Left.hpp and Left.cpp. 
Have the executable print out difference from Pi for both Trap and Left.

- spectre example: irreducible mass, christodoulou mass
