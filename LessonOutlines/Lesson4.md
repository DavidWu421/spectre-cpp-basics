## Lesson 4
  - Lambdas and functors
    - Revisit trapezoid integrator
      - Template on type instead of taking a function pointer
      - Pass in a function
      - Pass in a functor (struct with operator() const member function)
      - Pass in a lambda
  - Metaprogramming
    - brigand library
    - tmpl::list<>
    - printing types at runtime
    - printing types at compile time
    - integer arithmetic, boolean logic at compile time
